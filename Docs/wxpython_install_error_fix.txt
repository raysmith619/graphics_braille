  ERROR: Failed building wheel for wxpython
Failed to build wxpython
error: failed-wheel-build-for-install

One approach - install from wheel
From pypi wxPython entry, find wheel
Example: 
"C:\Users\Owner\Downloads\wxpython-4.2.3-cp313-cp313-win_amd64.whl"
Install this wheel.
Note that installing a wheel requires an exact python.exe.
In our case: 3.13.x python

Fully qualify the python.exe if your py doesn't access the desired python.ext:
PS C:\Users\raysm\vscode\graphics_braille_main> c:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe  -m pip --no-cache-dir install C:\Users\Owner\Downloads\wxpython-4.2.3-cp313-cp313-win_amd64.whl  --force-reinstall
Processing c:\users\owner\downloads\wxpython-4.2.3-cp313-cp313-win_amd64.whl

Small note about py, the python launcher.
As I had several python installations and I needed to run an "older" one,
I wanted py to execute my particular one.
Added py.ini file to the launcher directory.
In my case: C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Launcher
My py.ini:
[defaults]
python=3.13
